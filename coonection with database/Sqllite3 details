SQLite is a C library that is commonly used with Python. 
Python provides a built-in module called sqlite3 that serves as an interface to the SQLite database engine. 
The sqlite3 module allows Python programs to interact with SQLite databases using a set of convenient functions and classes.
The sqlite3 module is part of the Python Standard Library, which means it comes bundled with Python and does not require any additional installation steps.
It provides a high-level API that simplifies working with SQLite databases, allowing you to create, connect to, query, and modify databases using Python code.
The sqlite3 module in Python supports most of the standard SQL functionality, such as executing SQL statements, parameterized queries, transaction management, and working with result sets.
